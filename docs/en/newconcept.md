The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He
did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me
that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had
come.
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he said.
Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets
you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite. During a
holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: 'sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You
will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.' If you receive a
request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!

My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on
the stage as a young girl. Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of
seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play,
she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she
always answers, 'Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!'

After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it
wasn't there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.
'Did you have a good meal?" he asked.
'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'
The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to
me.
'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken in into the garden. He often does this!'

'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.
'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.
'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said.
I went back to the ticket office at once.
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'
'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.

Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard
night and day. The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it
came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise. I am one of the
few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been offered alarge sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody says I must be mad and they are
probably right.

My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we
were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. She
threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in
Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters
will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.
